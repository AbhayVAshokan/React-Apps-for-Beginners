The repository contains react app ideas for beginners. It was started with JSX, and later migrated to TypeScript. Take my tip: the best way to learn TypeScript is by migrating an existing JSX project.

1. **Counter**: A simple counter application with two buttons, one to increment and the other to decrement.
2. **RandomUser API**: Introduction to how to consume a RESTApi. This app uses a random user API which provides information about a random user. 
3. **Calculator**: An interactive calculator application with all basic arithmetic operations and an aesthetic UI.
4. **Hackernews**: Hackernews is a famous API for fetching popular news articles. This application contains an interactive web page which renders the top 500 best stories/top stories/new stories. A search feature is also provided.

The applications are not optimized for performance. These were created for brushing up my react skills. All contributions are welcome.
